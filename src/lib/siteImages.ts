/**
 * Centralized image configuration for Global Line Safaris.
 *
 * Hero / page-background imagery comes from /public/images, sourced from the
 * supplied photo set in /public/Images. Files were copied to clean kebab-case
 * slugs so URLs contain no spaces or double extensions; originals are untouched.
 *   1. Drop new files under /public/images (or /public/Images for raw drops).
 *   2. Point the slot below at the new path — no component changes needed.
 *
 * Team avatars intentionally stay in /public/gls/team because they are
 * photographs of named people, not scene/background imagery.
 *
 * All URLs are served through next/image for automatic optimization.
